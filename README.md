# Hi, I'm Bhav

I'm a data enthusiast and math educator with a strong interest in building tools that promote understanding and insight. I work primarily in R, Python, and SQL, and I'm passionate about using data to inform decision-making and support learning.

My work spans education analytics, applied statistics, and machine learning. I'm especially drawn to R for its expressiveness and power in all things statistics, it's also been the easiest language to teach some of my students.

I'm currently open to opportunities in data science, analytics, and applied research roles where I can contribute technical expertise and thoughtful analysis.
